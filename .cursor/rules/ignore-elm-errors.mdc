Always ignore the following errors

```
No definition found for `View.none`.
No definition found for `Page`.
No definition found for `Page.new`.
No definition found for `View`.
No definition found for `Route`.
```

In general, it's safe to ignore "No definition found" errors if the module / function that they're referring to is generated by `elm-land` (these would be inside `.elm-land/src` directory if you want to check to be sure).
